                            <p class="news-mobile-text">In 2023, Christian von Koenigsegg's "King of Cars" chattered its own world record, completing the 0-400-0 km/h run in just 28.81 seconds in Orebro Airport, Sweden, which previously was 31.6 seconds. This hybrid masterpiece showcases Swedish engineering at its finest, combining raw power with aerodynamic precision. Do you want some curiosities? Here you go! First: it eliminates the traditional gearbox, using a hydraulic coupling for low-speed acceleration (like an automatic) and the locks for direct drive, translating in a unique 1-gear transmission; electric motors provide continuous power, creating a seamless, relentless acceleration. Second: "Regera" means "to reign" or "to rule" in Swedish. Third: the custom titanium exhaust system features a vintage-style fishtail outlet, a design not used on production cars for over 50 years. Fourth: an optional aerodynamic package adds a front splitter, canards, side sills, and rear winglets to increase downforce. Fifth: its combination of a 5.0L twin-turbo V8 engine and three electric motors produces 1,500 horsepower; the hybrid system allows the car to be driven on electric power alone for short distances.</p>

                            Do you want some curiosities? Here you go! First: only 30 units were produced and it broke the record in its preproduction version. Second: the 8.0-litre quad-turbo W16 engine was upgraded to produce 1,600 horsepower and 1,600 Nm of torque with a higher redline of 7,100 rpm; it features specially engineered tires and upgraded brakes to handle the extreme speeds, the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission has longer ratios in the upper gears to help achieve high top speeds, and the "longtail" design extends the car's rear to reduce drag, while vents over the front wheels release pressure and a vertical exhaust arrangement maximises the diffuser's efficiency. Third: owners receive special privileges, such as full access to the Ehra-Lessien test track and a team of engineers to help set up the car for the track, as the customer version is electronically limited to 273 mph.</p>

                            <p class="news-mobile-text">In 2002, Luca di Montezmolo presented the Ferrari Enzo, which married four consecutive years of supremacy in the Constructor's World Championship to the technical input and fine adjustment sensitivity of the World Champion Michael Schumacher. In Montezmolo's words: "The Ferrari Enzo is a historic car for Ferrari for many and various reasons. Therefore we had to chose a name with a strong symbolic significance and that was the name of the Company founder,". Calling upon this wealth of knowledge, the aim was to develop a car as an integrated system aimed at achieving extreme performance. A system where even driver performance limits could be improved through a Formula 1 man/machine interface. The new Ferrari Enzo required a special and in-depth technical collaboration with Brembo (in charge of its braking system made of composite ceramic material and providing a 30% saving in weight over similar cast iron units), Bridgestone (in charge of its F1 tyres and being able to reach speeds of over 218mph or 250km/h), Magneti Marelli (in charge of its transmission systems, developing a gear change concept that extends nowadays in all Ferrari and Maserati cars) and OMR (in charge of its pedal platform, featuring aluminium accelerator and brake pedals with 16 adjustable positions). Do you want some curiosities? Here you go! First: the Ferrari Enzo is powered by a 5998cc V12 engine; Second: it has a F1 gearbox; Third: it was built almost entirely in a carbon-fiber body; Fourth: only 399 units were ever built, between the years 2002 and 2004.</p>

                            <p class="news-mobile-text">In August 1993, the McLaren F1 (prototype XP3) became the fastest production car in the world, reaching 231 mph (372 km/h) during performance tests at the Nardò bowl in Italy—a glimpse of the machine's potential. Five years later, on 31 March 1998, the XP5 prototype, driven by Andy Wallace, broke its own record by achieving a two-way average of 240.1 mph (386.4 km/h) at the Ehra-Lessien proving ground, earning a Guinness World Record that stood unchallenged until the Koenigsegg CCR reached 245 mph (394 km/h) in 2005. What made the F1 remarkable was its purity: no turbocharging, no hybrid systems—just a naturally aspirated BMW V12 and a vision of British engineering perfection. Do you want some curiosities? Here you go! First: the F1 features a central driving position but has two more seats to the side, a design intended for better weight distribution and a more focused driving experience. Second: the car came with unique accessories, such as Tag Heuer watch and luggage tailored to fit the car's compartments. Third: only 106 F1s were produced between 1992 and 1998, making it an exclusive and highly sought-after collector's item. Fourth: it was the first production car to feature a full carbon fibre monocoque chassis and the engine bay uses real gold foil for its heat-reflecting properties, helping to keep the BMW-sourced V12 cool.</p>

                            <p class="news-mobile-text">In 1966, the Ford GT40 made history by defeating Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans — marking the first time an American automaker had ever won the legendary endurance race. The GT40 MkII achieved a dominant 1-2-3 finish, breaking Ferrari's five-year winning streak and proving Ford's engineering supremacy on the global stage. The victory wasn't a one-off: in 1967, the GT40 MkIV — the first car designed and built entirely in the United States — repeated the triumph. The streak continued in 1968 and 1969, with the GT40 MkI securing back-to-back victories, cementing the car's legacy as one of motorsport's most iconic machines. Did you know...? This car is called GT40 because GT stands for "Grand Touring" and "40" refers to the car's height of 40 inches (about 1.02 metres) from the ground to the top of the windshield. The name was chosen to reflect the car's low profile as required by racing regulations and its purpose as a high-performance grand touring race car. In fact, its nickname is the "J-car" because it was designed to meet the new Appendix J regulations for FIA racing cars.</p>

                            <p class="news-desktop-text-right">In 2002, Luca di Montezmolo presented the Ferrari Enzo, which married four consecutive years of supremacy in the Constructor's World Championship to the technical input and fine adjustment sensitivity of the World Champion Michael Schumacher. In Montezmolo's words: "The Ferrari Enzo is a historic car for Ferrari for many and various reasons. Therefore we had to chose a name with a strong symbolic significance and that was the name of the Company founder,". Calling upon this wealth of knowledge, the aim was to develop a car as an integrated system aimed at achieving extreme performance. A system where even driver performance limits could be improved through a Formula 1 man/machine interface. The new Ferrari Enzo required a special and in-depth technical collaboration with Brembo (in charge of its braking system made of composite ceramic material and providing a 30% saving in weight over similar cast iron units), Bridgestone (in charge of its F1 tyres and being able to reach speeds of over 218mph or 250km/h), Magneti Marelli (in charge of its transmission systems, developing a gear change concept that extends nowadays in all Ferrari and Maserati cars) and OMR (in charge of its pedal platform, featuring aluminium accelerator and brake pedals with 16 adjustable positions). Do you want some curiosities? Here you go! First: the Ferrari Enzo is powered by a 5998cc V12 engine; Second: it has a F1 gearbox; Third: it was built almost entirely in a carbon-fiber body; Fourth: only 399 units were ever built, between the years 2002 and 2004.</p>

                            <p class="news-desktop-text-left">In August 1993, the McLaren F1 (prototype XP3) became the fastest production car in the world, reaching 231 mph (372 km/h) during performance tests at the Nardò bowl in Italy—a glimpse of the machine's potential. Five years later, on 31 March 1998, the XP5 prototype, driven by Andy Wallace, broke its own record by achieving a two-way average of 240.1 mph (386.4 km/h) at the Ehra-Lessien proving ground, earning a Guinness World Record that stood unchallenged until the Koenigsegg CCR reached 245 mph (394 km/h) in 2005. What made the F1 remarkable was its purity: no turbocharging, no hybrid systems—just a naturally aspirated BMW V12 and a vision of British engineering perfection. Do you want some curiosities? Here you go! First: the F1 features a central driving position but has two more seats to the side, a design intended for better weight distribution and a more focused driving experience. Second: the car came with unique accessories, such as Tag Heuer watch and luggage tailored to fit the car's compartments. Third: only 106 F1s were produced between 1992 and 1998, making it an exclusive and highly sought-after collector's item. Fourth: it was the first production car to feature a full carbon fibre monocoque chassis and the engine bay uses real gold foil for its heat-reflecting properties, helping to keep the BMW-sourced V12 cool.</p>

                            <p class="news-desktop-text-right">In 1966, the Ford GT40 made history by defeating Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans — marking the first time an American automaker had ever won the legendary endurance race. The GT40 MkII achieved a dominant 1-2-3 finish, breaking Ferrari's five-year winning streak and proving Ford's engineering supremacy on the global stage. The victory wasn't a one-off: in 1967, the GT40 MkIV — the first car designed and built entirely in the United States — repeated the triumph. The streak continued in 1968 and 1969, with the GT40 MkI securing back-to-back victories, cementing the car's legacy as one of motorsport's most iconic machines. Did you know...? This car is called GT40 because GT stands for "Grand Touring" and "40" refers to the car's height of 40 inches (about 1.02 metres) from the ground to the top of the windshield. The name was chosen to reflect the car's low profile as required by racing regulations and its purpose as a high-performance grand touring race car. In fact, its nickname is the "J-car" because it was designed to meet the new Appendix J regulations for FIA racing cars.</p>
